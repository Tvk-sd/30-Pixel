30 Pixel
An exploration of privacy theater in the age of facial recognition.
A privacy-first experiment exploring the paradox of feeling secure in a connected world.


The Concept
30 Pixel is built on an oxymoron: it creates a comforting illusion of anonymity by pixelating your face, while simultaneously using Google's facial recognition software and multiple APIs to process your image. 
The app plays with our contradictory relationship to privacy where we feel protected behind a pixelated mask, yet sophisticated technology is actively tracking and identifying our faces beneath it.
Adding another layer of irony, this entire project runs publicly on GitHub. While most casual internet users assume their data stays private, the transparent, open-source nature of this platform means anyone can see exactly how the "privacy" is constructed.

Tech Stack
Think of this web app like a film production:

HTML – The studio floor plan (where cameras, lights, and monitors go)
CSS – The set design and lighting (making it look good)
JavaScript – The director (telling everyone what to do)
MediaStream API – The camera crew (capturing live footage)
Canvas API – The editing suite (modifying the video in real-time)
MediaPipe – The AI assistant (automatically detecting and tracking faces)
MediaRecorder – The recording equipment (saving the final video)
